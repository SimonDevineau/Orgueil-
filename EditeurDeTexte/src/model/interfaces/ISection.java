/**
 * The section is as important as the document because a document is composed of
 * sections. However, the sections and the document have in common the
 * introductory text and the subsections. Knowing that fact it seems obvious
 * that a section is a particular document because it is a document plus a
 * title. That is why an inheritance relationship has been used for the section
 * and the document --> Section extends Document. <br/>
